## Best Practices

### Image Acquisition
1. **Lighting Conditions**
   - Use consistent, diffuse lighting
   - Avoid shadows and specular reflections
   - Maintain uniform illumination across samples

2. **Camera Settings**
   - Use manual focus for consistent sharpness
   - Set appropriate white balance
   - Avoid digital zoom for measurement accuracy
   - Use tripod for stability

3. **Sample Preparation**
   - Ensure samples are flat and properly oriented
   - Avoid overlapping or touching samples
   - Use neutral background for contrast
   - Keep samples clean and dry

### Measurement Validation
1. **Reference Scale**
   - Use standardized reference objects
   - Place reference in same plane as samples
   - Verify reference dimensions are accurate
   - Include reference in every image

2. **Quality Control**
   - Check for consistent measurement units
   - Verify sample count matches expectations
   - Review boundary detection accuracy
   - Validate against manual measurements

### Data Management
1. **File Organization**
   - Use descriptive file naming conventions
   - Maintain metadata with each analysis
   - Archive original images with results
   - Version control for analysis parameters

2. **Statistical Analysis**
