## 1. Overview of the Publication Process

Scientific publishing generally includes seven stages:

1. Research preparation and identifying innovation
2. Manuscript writing and formatting
3. Journal selection and submission
4. Peer review and revision
5. Acceptance
6. Proof and In Press (online-first publication)
7. Final publication and post-release maintenance

## 3. Research Preparation

### 3.1 Define the Core Contribution

- Identify one clear innovation: a method, instrument, or biological insight.
- Choose paper type:
  - Research Article: new findings
  - Method Paper: new algorithms or tools
  - Review: literature summary

### 3.2 Select a Suitable Journal

| Field                               | Example Journals                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Crop phenotyping and photosynthesis | Plant Phenomics, Plant Methods                                     |
| Remote sensing and modeling         | Remote Sensing of Environment, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology |

## 10. Summary

Publishing a scientific paper is a systematic and transparent process of communicating new research findings.
Success depends on rigorous methodology, precise writing, and consistent improvement.

Define innovation → Write carefully → Submit strategically → Revise seriously → Cite correctly.

Here I'm sharing the journal analysis I've compiled, hoping it can be helpful to everyone. [**CSV**](/file/2025_Journal_analysis_Liangchao-Deng.xlsx)
